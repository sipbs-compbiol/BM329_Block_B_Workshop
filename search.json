    "text": "1.1 Dendrograms (Tree Diagrams) and Evolution\nIn this workshop, you will produce dendrograms: these are tree diagrams that can represent the process of evolution. You have already seen tree diagrams, like those in Figure 1.1, used on this course to represent the process of evolution.\nTypically, in evolutionary analyses, you will see that these trees are organised to show a progression through time. The leaves of the tree usually represent things that exist “now” or, at least, most recently (these are at the right hand side of Figure 1.1).\nThe dendrogram traces lines - branches - from the leaves, and these gradually meet up together, just as branches of a real tree do, as you progress from right to left in Figure 1.1. Eventually, they all meet up together at the oldest (left-most, in Figure 1.1) part of the tree, (called the root).\nTrees like this can be used to represent large-scale evolution, like the complete Tree of Life in Figure 1.1, or evolution on a small scale. For example, Figure 1.2 represents evolution of the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a UK hospital. This tree was used to trace the source of infection in a burns unit, ultimately locating the precise valve in the plumbing from which the infectious agent was finding its way into patients (Quick et al. (2014)).",

    "section": "1.2 Interpreting a tree",
    "text": "1.2 Interpreting a tree\nThe trees in Figure 1.1 and Figure 1.2 both imply a branching evolutionary process. A single common ancestor to every organism represented at one of the leaves existed at some point in history, and that date in history is on the very leftmost point of the tree. The rest of the tree is a representation of how evolution progressed from that single ancestor to the variety of organisms represented at the leaf nodes.\n\n1.2.1 Branch lengths\nAs you move from left-to-right in those trees, there is a short horizontal line (the root) that represents time passing for that ancestor. But then the branch splits into two (it diverges), representing some kind of event that produces distinct “offspring.” Each of these proceeds through time as a horizontal line for a distance before itself diverging to result in two new, differentiable offspring, and so on and so on until the leaf nodes are reached.\nThe lengths of the branches here represent, in some way, the passage of time between consecutive divergences (or a leaf node and the most recent split). The longer the branch, the longer the passage of time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe length of a branch doesn’t necessarily correspond exactly to time\n\n\n\n\n\nIn practice, when we make these trees, we are usually measuring something other than time, itself. More often we are measuring some kind of difference between the leaf nodes, and assuming that a difference of 200 corresponds to 200 units of time (years, millennia, etc.), and a difference of 1000 corresponds to 1000 units.\nBiology is complicated, and this assumption rarely holds exactly. There are methods to try to turn our measurements accurately into units of time, but they are beyond the scope of this course.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Cladograms and Phylograms\nThere is more than one kind of dendrogram. Two types you will meet frequently are:\n\nphylograms: each branch length is intended to represent the passage of time (or some other measure of difference) - they represent change on an evolutionary timescale\ncladograms: all branch lengths are the same - they do not represent change on an evolutionary timescale, only the order of divergences in the tree\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Phylogram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Cladogram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: In a phylogram the branch lengths may be uneven. They represent evolutionary time between nodes (divergences and/or leaves on the tree), and the time between those may vary. In a cladogram the branch lengths are identical and the tree only represents topology - the order in which branches diverge.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Topology\nTopology is the order of branching in a tree: the order of divergence events from the common ancestor of all leaf nodes to the present. Two trees with the same order of branching, but different branch lengths, have the same topology, and imply the same sequence of divergences.\nFor example, in Figure 1.3 the first divergence separates Mouse from all the other mammals, and then the next divergence separates Bovine from the primates. Whether you examine the phylogram or the cladogram, the order of branching - the topology - of the tree is the same. They represent the same evolutionary sequence of events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nEven if two trees share the same topology, and the same sequence of events, if any branch lengths differ the trees might still represent different evolutionary histories as the times between those events may differ.\n\n\nTwo trees can look superficially different, but actually represent the same sequence of branching events, and even the same evolutionary history, as is the case in Figure 1.4. Here, the tree has been rotated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Original tree\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Tree with rotation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: In any tree, branches can be rotated around an internal node without changing the structure or interpretation of the tree. Here, the two leaf nodes highlighted in purple (Figure 1.4 (a)) are rotated around their common ancestor to give the tree in (Figure 1.4 (b)). The rotated conformation is highlighted in green. Even though the two trees look different, the evolutionary relationships they represent are identical.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nIs the tree represented in Figure 1.4 the same tree shown in Figure 1.3 (a)?",

    "section": "1.3 Evolution and Clustering",
    "text": "1.3 Evolution and Clustering\nThe examples in Figure 1.1, Figure 1.2, and Figure 1.4 are representations of evolution. In all cases, two organisms that share a more recent common ancestor (like Chimp and Human in Figure 1.4) combine together at a closer node than do two more distantly-related organisms (like Chimp and Gibbon).\nIt is natural to think of this representation as the divergence of species, as Gibbon diverging from ancestral primates at an earlier stage than Gorilla diverging from the ancestor of Chimp and Human. But it is also a representation of clustering. What this means is that we cluster Chimp more closely with Human than with Bovine because Chimp and Human share more similarities with each other than either do with Bovine.\nIn practice this means we can use mathematical approaches that cluster similar things together into trees to approximate evolutionary history, so long as what we use to measure similarity is relevant to evolution. Methods that perform this kind of clustering to produce a tree are called hierarchical clustering methods and you will use one of these to infer an evolutionary history for the `flu viruses you are evolving in the workshop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo different ways to reconstruct evolution\n\n\n\n\n\nHierarchical clustering methods are only one way to build an evolutionary tree. They were the first to be used, because they are not difficult to understand, and are relatively straightforward and quick to calculate. All of these methods use a matrix (table) of differences between organisms and apply an algorithm to construct a tree (or hierarchy - hence “hierarchical”). Methods that use this approach include Neighbour-Joining, and UPGMA.\nThe development of cheap, powerful computing enabled more advanced and more accurate alternative methods to be used routinely. These methods include Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian approaches that require significant computing power. These approaches differ from hierarchical clustering because they attempt to fit a model of evolution (like fitting a curve on a graph) to the data obtained from each organism, rather than using an algorithm to build a tree from distances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s build a tree\n\n\n\nLet’s get started with building a UPGMA tree by clicking on the link UPGMA (here, in the menu, or below)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHug, Laura A, Brett J Baker, Karthik Anantharaman, Christopher T Brown, Alexander J Probst, Cindy J Castelle, Cristina N Butterfield, et al. 2016. “A New View of the Tree of Life.” Nat.
