# BM329 Workshop Preparation Instructions - README

To prepare materials for the workshop: 

1. Print out the `flu-virus-strips.docx` file in colour and cut
into strips along the horizontal lines.

The file has enough strips to make 20 complete 'flu genomes. Print
an appropriate number for the size of your class/workshop group, 
remembering that you will need some extra 'flu genomes to allow 
for antigenic shift. 

2. Print out the `flu-virus-strips-zoonotic.docx` file in color and cut 
into strips along the horizontal lines.

The file has enough strips to make 15 zoonotic 'flu genomes. Print 
an appropriate number for the size of your class/workshop group, 
adjusting as desired based on the frequency of animal contact
likely to result in 'flu infection. 

3. Assemble a `pool` of pre-assembled viruses, using the strips from steps 1 and 2
(put 1 of each type of genome strip into an envelope - a "correctly assembled" 
'flu genome will have PB1, PB2, PA, NP, HA, NA, M, and NS segments).

The size of the "pool" needed will depend on class/workshop size. Suggest having 
the pool the same size as the class (that way there will be plenty of spares for 
co-infections.)

4. Print out a copy of the instructions for each student 
(`BM329_Workshop_B_Instructions.docx`). 

If you wish to include a second round (with vaccines), print 
a copy of the additional instructions (`BM329_Workshop_B_Instructions-
For_Additional_Round_If-Time.docx`).
